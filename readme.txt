-   Removed lock and \_monei_payment_id_processed flag
Analysis revealed WooCommerce creates orders BEFORE payment (unlike PrestaShop),
so duplicate order creation is impossible. The lock and processed flag were:
1. Broken - wp_cache not persistent without external cache
2. Harmful - flag blocked AUTHORIZEDâ†’SUCCEEDED and SUCCEEDEDâ†’REFUNDED transitions
3. Unnecessary - WooCommerce's payment_complete() is already idempotent
Removed components:
-   WC_Monei_Lock_Helper class
-   Lock acquisition/release in IPN and redirect handlers
-   \_monei_payment_id_processed flag checks and setting
-   wp_cache stubs from PHPStan bootstrap
The order status check provides sufficient protection against duplicate processing.
Any duplicate order notes are cosmetic and acceptable.
